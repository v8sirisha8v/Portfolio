<!--Description of project-->
<p> <br> During this image manipulation project, I chose to manipulate images of my client's company. Due to my interest for the creation of virtual and augmented reality, I made my client's product virtual reality software, called Imaginiti. This project that I accomplished was definitely the most challenging but exhilarating coding experience that I had gone through. When starting, I brainstormed ideas, and essentially wanted overlays on my images more than frames, with creative logos to match the "imaginative" sense of virtual worlds. While going through this process, my first main challenge was that the code simply didn't show up on my page. Though, after a series of saving my code and changing my data precisely, my code worked (an incredible feeling!). After having manipulations present on my code, I messed around with the code, and made an image I was pretty proud of: <br> <br>
<img src="https://github.com/v8sirisha8v/Portfolio/blob/master/vrscreenshot.PNG?raw=true"width=150 height=100> 
<br> <br> This image looked really neat and creative, with the virtual world on the TV, as if the VR goggles the boy was looking at was the "world" on the screen. But, there was a problem: my algorithm was not flexible. Any image that my client provided wouldn't look good with this image. This second challenge allowed me to learn about how coding needs to be pertaining to a user or a customer, instead of random ideas that which I had thought of. I grasped how to use the pillow library and various documentations to get my code to work; being efficient. In all, this project helped me learn how to overcome various challenges while coding, while always, maintaining creativity in my final product. </p>
