    <h3> <strong> Google Headquarters Field Trip </strong> </h3>
  <p> Here's my experience with this event! </p>

    <p> I was one out of fifteen girls picked to go to Google to listen to Kari Byron's talk about her new show: <em> Crash Test World, </em> a show about emphasizing how history, technology, culture and people are coming together, to make the world a better place. Kari Byron and Jenny Buccos discussed how this TV show would listen to other people's way of living, their culture, different topics such as the Cold War, the Berlin Wall, World War II, etc. The nature of the show was to learn how various aspects of our life around the world contribute to our way of life. What stuck out to be was their warmth, listening to other's ideas. The show's goal was to inspire people, to bring people together. From that presentation, I realized that through becoming a software engineer in AR, I also wanted to travel, I wanted to connect with people and help people through technology. This talk inspired me to have a inquisitive mindset, to help, travel around the world, and most importantly, to grow.
