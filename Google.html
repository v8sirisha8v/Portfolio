    <p> I was one out of fifteen girls picked to go to Google to listen to Kari Byron's talk about her new show: <em> Crash Test World, </em> a show about emphasizing how history, technology, culture and people are coming together, to make the world a better place. Kari Byron and Jenny Buccos discussed how this TV show would listen to other people's way of living, their culture, different topics such as the Cold War, the Berlin Wall, World War II, etc. The nature of the show was to learn and to help, to be curious. This inspired me to have a inquisitive mindset,  to help, travel around the world, and most importantly, to grow.
