  <p> Doing martial arts for 11 years I've learnt how to become a leader. As a 2nd degree black belt, I help teach martial art techniques to many students. I've lead classes, helped during tests, supported my tribe during conditioning, and critiqued student's form. In martial arts, I'm part of LDT, the Leadership Development Team. These classes prepare me to teach kids, to memorize curriculum, and most of all, motivate kids to get engaged in martial arts. I've learned to modify curriculum for different age group of students, have tiny competitions to see who does the grappling patterns faster, making kids enthusiastic for karate. By teaching them curriculum, I help them get to their next belt in no time.<p>
