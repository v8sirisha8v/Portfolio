      <h5> <strong> Escape Room Project - <em> The Labryinth</em> </h5> </strong> 
      <p> <strong> Project: </strong> Escape Room Project <br> <strong> Course: </strong> Computer Science Principles (CSP) <br> <strong> Duration: </strong> Approximately 8 days (Jan 22, 2019 - Jan 30, 2019)
      <br> <strong> Objective: </strong> Create an Escape Room Game/Story that has a consistent theme with different challenges that players have to solve! The user's input should affect the storyline. Finally, <strong> no loops are allowed,    only functions. </strong> <br> 
      <strong> Type of Project: </strong> Group Project </p>

  <p> <br> Our Escape Room Project had a consistent "greek" theme, with our main focus on the Labryinth. I didn't exactly have a specific role in this project, as my partner and I worked together in all the different aspects of this project. One of the main challenges throughout this project was <strong> coding without loops, only functions. </strong> We had to find new ways to code certain parts, that would otherwise use for loops. Additionally, my partner and I struggled in some of our code due to many glitches and errors, and we had to code certain sections in case the user types an input that wasn't supposed to be put in the story/game. Though, by working together, communicating, and being persistant, we fixed these errors. Planning this escape room helped me discover how to design and plan a storyline, through organized flowcharts and brainstorms. Our project had many complicated concepts, that we had to carefully implement in our code, also helping us have clean code. Lastly, our team dynamic was exceptional; we consistently communicated to each other when there had been problems. We texted each other or communicated on google docs if there was a certain idea that we wanted to incorporate, or if we needed to fix an error. We combined our ideas and shared workloads, collaborating well. Overall, this project helped me grow in terms of designing an idea and teamwork. </p>
