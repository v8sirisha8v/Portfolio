  <h3> <strong> AACI - Asian American Community Involvement </strong> </h3>
  <p> Here's my experience with AACI! </p>

  <p> Many asian immigrants face issues relating to abuse and poverty, which AACI addresses. AACI offer physical and mental health services, assisting victims to stand back up from their moments in adversity. I wanted to assist this vulnerable community. Asians aren't usually known for seeking mental health services due to cultural factors. I wanted to help this organization due to their focus on a community that isn't known for having mental health issues. To assist them, I created a fundraiser at my karate school's Christmas party, selling cookies that my family baked. Through about 2 hours, we raised $200. Giving back doesn't take much, but the results made me feel empowered. Little actions like these make a difference, and I'm hoping to contribute more to lift Asian Americans back onto their feet.<p>
