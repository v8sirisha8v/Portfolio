    <h3> <strong> JA S.H.E Leads </strong> </h3>
  <p> Here's my experience with this event! </p>

    <p> The event allowed me to meet plenty of successful business women, and inspired me to take on more leadership roles instead of shying away. At the beginning, we had a speaker who emphasized how we shouldn't apologize for being too strong-voiced, and that anyone of us could be leaders. This changed my point of view on my career. I had aspired to be an Augmented Reality programmer, but having my <em> own </em> ideas to impact the world, that would be amazing. I didn't have to be a follower. Later on, I attended the <em> Emerging Technologies </em> Workshop, where we were free to talk about our different ideas that could change the world. We were introduced to numerous emerging technologies, one being Augmented Reality. Our speakers discussed <em> Pokemon Go </em>, and the different applications Augmented Reality could have on our life, giving me ideas on what I could do to further my interest in this industry. I learned that Niantic, the creator of <em> Pokemon Go </em>, is a wonderful company that I could find opportunities in. Most of all, through this experience, I gained confidence that I could turn my ideas into something impactful, instead of being a common worker for a company.
