          <p> Hello! My name is Sirisha Velavan, and I’m currently a freshman at Dublin High School. My goal is to pursue a career in the industry of virtual or augmented reality as a programmer.  Creating has consistently proven to be my passion, either it be creating apps or stories. Additionally, starting from a young age, I had a major interest in solving puzzles. Pursuing a career that fit the creative and problem-solving aspect was my goal. Virtual Reality had definitely matched this description. Furthermore, the field of VR and AR is severely vast, with numerous possibilities. VR and AR can be used for teaching, entertainment, physical exercise, treat phobias, etc, and I want to be a part of the creation in this growing industry. Currently, my plans to achieve this goal are to complete various internships in different colleges and tech companies, volunteer at the Chabot Space Center to enhance my leadership skills, participate in hackathons, join the Robotics club and other clubs that help me get into coding competitions, and get into the Engineering Academy to explore the field of technology and engineering. With this, I will work towards a degree in Computer Science in a University of California campus. 
          <br> <br>
	        I have participated in mixed martial arts since the age of 4, and am currently a second-degree black belt. At my karate school, I often help as a teacher, helping others learn techniques. If students don’t understand, I stay patient and attempt to approach teaching the technique a different way. Teaching had taught me various communication, public speaking, and leadership skills.  Additionally, I was part of both a recreational and competitive soccer team in the span of a year. Being on a competitive team had proven to be a rough time for me, as I had been playing for merely a year. My teammates were on a whole different skill level and I often feared judgment from my peers. Despite this, I continued making practices, learning to be a persistent player. Furthermore, our team had to support each other consistently, on and off the field. I learned how to communicate with my team to reach a common goal (literally and figuratively). I was also a past piano player and singer. Playing piano and singing unleashed my artistic side, letting my thinking go in more abstract ways. Currently, I am part of the Dublin High School Technovation Club, in which I am brainstorming app ideas that can change a current problem in society with my partner. We use our creative and innovative thinking in developing app ideas that may provide a solution to that current problem, cooperating throughout the process. 
          <br> <br>
          In martial arts, I was nominated as a best tester for my first-degree test and earned an award for having a well-kept training journal. Additionally I had been on a recreational and competitive soccer team. Being a piano player, I had reached Level 5 in Certificate of Merit. Throughout eighth grade and high school, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA, and have received honor roll for all of my middle school and high school years. Additonally, I created a fundraiser that donated money to the Asian Americans for Community Involvement. By baking cookies and selling cookies at a Christmas party, I raised money that worked towards helping the many Asian immigrant communities in the Bay Area whose mental health had been deprived of. Many of these victims have suffered drug abuse, health problems, poverty, physical abuse, and mental abuse. 
          <br> <br> 
	        Therefore, my experiences have shaped me into an intelligent, persistent, and creative high school student. The skills I’ve gained and my accomplishments make me well-fit for my career goal. Please take a look at the rest of my website for more details.
