      <p> The idea of a book drive came out as a spark from a mess of random ideas. Our love for books and our want to help people who, unfortunately, had less resources drove us to start a book drive.  <em>The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind</em>, a book and movie based on a true story, shows the struggles of people in Africa. He used his science book to help him guide him, so that he could build a windmill to save his village from a famine. A simple book allowed a boy to change his whole village. Imagine the thousands of differences, life-altering changes that could be made to these Africans. Therefore, we considered three organizations: International Book Project, Books for Africa, and The African Library Project, and ended up with the African Library Project, where we could build a library in Malawi! We emailed different schools in our area, and they were willing to host book drives in their area. I made flyers that could go around the school. My group members made a GoFundMe page to get money for the shipping fee, as a sponsor wasn't working out for us. At the end, we did it! We had surpassed the original number of books we needed, through a lot of communication and effort. I learned about collaboration, as we had a rough start to get ideas, handle the work, get shipment fees, etc. We helped many African children get their education, and maybe, like William Kamkwamba, use that knowledge to grow their lives.  <p>
