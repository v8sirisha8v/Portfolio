         <p> <strong> Instructions: </strong> HELP! Nemo was stolen by a scuba diver! Dory and Marlin are taking you with them on an adventure to find Nemo. During the story, you will have different buttons for options on how you want the story to go. Remember, choose wisely! The wrong choice could end up with a few dead fish... Good luck!

<!--Description of project-->
<p> <br> For the Scratch project, my partner and I chose to go with creating a story (other than the game)<span id="dots"> ... </span><span id="more">. Creating a story seemed to allow us to use our creativity more freely. The objective whilst creating a story was primarily to create a story with multiple acts. The users should be able to affect the storyline based on their choices, and generally affect the story throughout (using keyboard/mouse input). My specific role in the project was to fix glitches and create new scenes. At the start, we had little difficulty choosing our topic: a recreation of <em> Finding Nemo</em>. We had various storylines when Marlin and Dory were attempting to find Nemo: going to the dentist office, the whales, sharks, etc. Creating the various scenes using code was definitely more difficult. Various glitches appeared in our story. Buttons wouldn't disappear after being clicked, characters would move too fast, and the scenes would sometimes get mixed up. To overcome these challenges, my partner and I communicated effectively and consistently, letting the other know about the present challenges. When one of us couldn't fix the problem, the other would. Throughout the project, I learned how to code with Scratch and communicate with my partner more effectively through experimenting with different code, searching up solutions through Google, and contacting my partner when challenges were present. Overall, our project was exceptional due to it's combination of code and creativity, accomplished through our teamwork.</span> </p>

<p> <br> During this image manipulation project, I chose to manipulate images of my client's company. Due to my interest for the creation of virtual and augmented reality, I made my client's product virtual reality software, called Imaginiti <span id="dotz"> ...</span><span id="moree">. This project that I accomplished was definitely the most challenging but exhilarating coding experience that I had gone through. When starting, I brainstormed ideas, and essentially wanted overlays on my images more than frames, with creative logos to match the "imaginative" sense of virtual worlds. While going through this process, my first main challenge was that the code simply didn't show up on my page. Though, after a series of saving my code and changing my data precisely, my code worked (an incredible feeling!). After having manipulations present on my code, I messed around with the code, and made an image I was pretty proud of: <br>
<img src="https://github.com/v8sirisha8v/Portfolio/blob/master/vrscreenshot.PNG?raw=true"width=150 height=100> 
<br> This image looked really neat and creative, with the virtual world on the TV, as if the VR goggles the boy was looking at was the "world" on the screen. But, there was a problem: my algorithm was not flexible. Any image that my client provided wouldn't look good with this image. This second challenge allowed me to learn about how coding needs to be pertaining to a user or a customer, instead of random ideas that which I had thought of. I grasped how to use the pillow library and various documentations to get my code to work; being efficient. In all, this project helped me learn how to overcome various challenges while coding, while always, maintaining creativity in my final product.</span>
